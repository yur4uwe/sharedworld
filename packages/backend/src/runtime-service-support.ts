/**
 * Service-side session resolution helpers.
 *
 * Responsibility:
 * Centralize the protocol decisions that turn a resolved runtime state into
 * connect / wait / host behavior.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * The caller already resolved the current runtime and preferred waiter candidate.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 * Decisions are based only on authoritative runtime state plus the current candidate.
 *
 * Stale-work rule:
 * Helpers never infer authority from local client state. They only interpret the
 * backend runtime record that was already resolved for this request.
 *
 * Authority source:
 * The resolved runtime record is authoritative.
