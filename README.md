# SharedWorld

Keep a Minecraft world going with friends without running a dedicated server.

## Install

SharedWorld currently supports Fabric on Minecraft `1.21.6-11` and `26.1.x`.

To use it, install:

- SharedWorld
- Fabric API
- `e4mc 6.1.2`

If you create a SharedWorld, you will also need to link Google Drive so the mod
can store that world's backups and handoff data in the app data folder.
The mod only has access to its own app data folder, not your entire drive.

## Usage

1. Create a single-player world. Enter for it to load and leave it.
2. In 'Multiplayer' option in the main menu, click 'Shared Worlds' button in top right corner of the screen. Its a switch that switches 'SharedWorld' menu and server menu
3. Click 'Create' button in the bottom menu.
4. Go through the setup process.
5. Enjoy the game

When one player leaves, another player can take over hosting and keep the same
world going. Friends connect through `e4mc`, so the active host can play from
their own client instead of keeping a dedicated server online.

The backend is public and can be self-hosted.
